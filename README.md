## This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
## to estimate the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field (BH) based on experimental data from tangent galvanometers with 50 and 500 turns.
## It integrates physics (Tangent Law) with data-driven modeling.
## Visualizations include angle vs current plots, training loss over epochs, and evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
## The trained model was saved for future predictions and analysis on unseen data.
